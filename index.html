            <h1>My Tech Journey</h1>
            <p>Honestly, I didn't think I'd ever be that “tech person” you know, the one who talks about bugs and codes like it's a superpower. But here we are. 😅 I started out just clicking random YouTube tutorials and trying to figure out what HTML even stands for. At first, everything felt confusing and scary but now I'm starting to get the hang of it. <br> I've built a couple of small things (some worked, some... not so much 😬), but every little win keeps me going. I'm currently diving into CSS and it feels like trying to control chaos with style 😂but it's actually kinda fun? My dream is to become a full-stack developer one day, but right now I'm just enjoying the ride, learning bit by bit, and hoping my code doesn't break the whole page. If you're reading this, send snacks or tutorials. Either works. 🤓✨</p>
